# Get started

Svelte App This project is my first attempt at using Svelte. Although I have extensive experience with AngularJS and Angular (versions 7, 8, 12 ... 16), I chose to try out Svelte for this assignment. The application is responsive and includes API calls. Please note that .env is not used due to some issues, so the URL is hardcoded at the moment.



Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
